urlshortener
============

(Under Development, incomplete)

Simple web service which can shorten and expand a URL, in a tinyurl / bitly fashion.

This project is primarily a thought exercise and a way of trying out a few different ideas.  Built using TDD/BDD so should have good test coverage.

TODO:
 * configuration via properties file
 * store simple data on disk
 * play with Berkely DB for scalability
 * anti-spam/anti-phishing?
 * track statistics?
